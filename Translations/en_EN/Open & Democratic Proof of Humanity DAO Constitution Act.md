### INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS
This document represents Open & Democratic Proof of Humanity Constitution Act as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO from now on). It will be divided into "sections" which in turn contain "articles" that will contain the constitutional text.
The constitutional text describes the basic foundations for creating a legal framework for the operation of the DAO from an organizational and administrative point of view. The technical operation of the project associated with the DAO is not described.
This organization will be constituted when this text is ratified by all of the authors of the text. This will be done by digitally signing the Keccak-256 hash of all the sections, this signature will be added at the end of this document.
With an altruistic spirit and the intention of achieving an inclusive DAO, where all voices are heard and all registered human persons are represented, from the basis of respect and freedom of expression, WE PROPOSE:

    b) By the presentation of a "Motion of Censure by the community" to the DAO. This must be brought to a public vote, where it must pass with 60% (sixty percent) of the total votes and then be ratified by at least 2 (two) MB.
    c) By the presentation of a "Motion of Censure of MB" by the other 4 (four) members of the MB as long as there is no vacancy, in case there is one, it shall be accepted by 3 MB (three).

    c) In case the requested MB is unable to carry out the request, he/she must make a post in the forum specifying who was contacted to make the request and the reason why he/she cannot carry out the task, accepting "personal inconveniences" as the cause.
